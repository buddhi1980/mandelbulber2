 * true standardized choice.
 *
 * Note that there is no canonical way to lift the defining
 * contour to the full Riemann surface because of the appearance
 * of a "hidden branch point" at z = 0 on non-principal sheets.
 * Experts will know the simple algebraic prescription for
 * obtaining the sheet they want; non-experts will not want
 * to know anything about it. This is why GSL chooses to compute

 * special consideration is given, since it is assumed that
 * no other machine representations of multiples of pi will
 * produce y = 0 precisely. This assumption depends on some
 * subtle properties of the machine arithmetic, such as
 * correct rounding and monotonicity of the underlying
 * implementation of sin() and cos().
